# Course Description

This introduction to R and RStudio will provide beginners with experience with loading, manipulating and visualising biological data using the tidyverse collection of R packages. The example data used is publicly available RNA-seq data, therefore attendees will gain experience in the structure and appearance of RNA-seq data.

This workshop has been developed collaboratively by training specialists at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and Melbourne Bioinformatics. It will be presented by Dr Maria Doyle (Application and Training Specialist, Peter Mac) and Dr Vicky Perreau (Senior Research Fellow - Bioinformatics Training, Melbourne Bioinformatics). 


## Learning objectives

At the end of the course, you will be able to:
•    Load tabular data into R
•    Apply tidyverse functions to manipulate data in R
•    Produce simple plots such boxplots using ggplot
•    Understand and apply data faceting in ggplot
•    Modify the aesthetics of a ggplot plot.
